Installation
============

Windows
=======
Create a folder for MiniDexed Control Center and unpack the files from the zip there.
At the first start, the MiniDexedCC will create a folder MiniDexedCC in the Users\UserName\ folder (e.g. c:\Users\Boban\MiniDexedCC). All the settings and the database file SysExDB.sqlite are stored there.


Linux
=====
Install the DEB file by using your preferred method.
Dependencies: Libc6, sqlite3, portmidi, libQt5Pas (if you are using the Qt5 version)

Note: libQt5pas distributed with Ubuntu and derivates is know to cause problems. 
Please use the builds from David Bannon: https://github.com/davidbannon/libqt5pas/releases
For Linux on 64-bit PC, you'll need libqt5pas1_2.11-1_amd64.deb


FreeBSD
=======
I didn't provide any installation's package for FreeBSD as I dont' know how to create one.
The plain binary is distibuted.
Dependencies: Libc6, sqlite3, portmidi, Qt5Pas
Optional: alsa_seq_server to access MIDI ports.

Instructions from probonopd ( https://github.com/probonopd/MiniDexed/discussions/196#discussioncomment-4412689 ):
